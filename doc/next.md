Fix the durn order link that is super broke.


Add flashes when things break


Add topics
 - to books, to articles, to authors, to sources

https://github.com/DataTables/DataTables
 - Solution for display articles. Better than current tables software because live search
 - Still can't minimize sections, sadly

Find out why there was error in mass add, I think on getting to the next page?
 - Clinical Trials failed

Hide styles or add value to them

Redo the following pages:
  All author paths
    bring in line with other parts, make more useful. Add description?
  All sources paths - these things are both ugly and useless.

Reorder articles and chapters within books
 - Set order as well I guess

Make 'delete chapter' buttons look neater - built into the panel thing on the right hand side.

Check out the navbar, and figure out where all the buttons should optimally go.

When sorting table, sort by multiple columns (or just add search) (or add dropdown or radio button to select common show points)

Add the MARO book(s) to the live site to have obvious use-cases around.

Create absolute route for the books/format page and remove article path

Get tricky with finding where people added data from to send them back there (create a chapter while binding, go back to binding, that kind of junk)

Complex JS tables, hide or display parts of the table at user leisure, so user gets only info relevant to them.

Examine not-logged-in browsing - basically locked out of everything. Fix or remove the buttons

Searching and limiting what is returned/displayed

Make 'choose article for book' useful

Look at what page to send people to after a new book is created/where they select articles for it.

STOP DUPLICATE ARTICLES YOU DUMMY!
 - Another task for SUPERCREATE!

STOP thousands of unformatted articles links nightmare.

Book edit page
Make this super-rich
  - Generate chapters on the fly
  - switch what chapter an article is in (dropdown choice button to assign chapter)


TOPICS
- Now its own table. Sort this out sometime.
- lots of has_and_belongs_to_many (articles, books, )
- Fuck it, learn how to use tags maybe?

- Authors and sources need the D in CRUD

- Articles _form add a new author or source
