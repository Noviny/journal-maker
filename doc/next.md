Reorder articles and chapters within books
 - Set order as well I guess


Complex JS tables, hide or display parts of the table at user leisure, so user gets only info relevant to them.

Make book status do something useful

Examine not-logged-in browsing - basically locked out of everything. Fix or remove the buttons

Add topics

Searching and limiting what is returned/displayed

Make 'choose article for book' useful



Book edit page
Make this super-rich
  - Generate chapters on the fly
  - switch what chapter an article is in (dropdown choice button to assign chapter)
  -re-order chapters
  -re-order articles


Sorting and filtering articles

Look back at topics, thanks



Add book links to second page to add articles to book.

- Make Book status mean anything (when visiting their show page)( 'new', 'editing', 'binding', 'published') (also I guess whether they are shown in 'all books')
- Viewable setting toggle option (nope, paid feature)



TOPICS
- Now its own table. Sort this out sometime.
- lots of has_and_belongs_to_many (articles, books, )
- Fuck it, learn how to use tags maybe?


- Books form must be able to include articles form

- Authors and sources need the D in CRUD
- Articles apparently have no D?

- Articles _form add a new author or source
