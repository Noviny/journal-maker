- Show and edit for book description and subheading fields

TOPICS
- Now its own table. Sort this out sometime.
- lots of has_and_belongs_to_many (articles, books, )

- Add MANY articles at once, do a mass upload
  - can we use Nokogiri to simplify this so they just provide urls and we grab all the details?
- Books form must be able to include articles form

- All Authors view
- All Sources view

- Articles _form need an author and source field
  - this needs to add authors and sources correctly if they don't exist, rather than checkbox or dropdown
