- Books need to have a description field
- Give Books a subheading field
- Books need to have chapters
- Books need a status (can be anything, probably just using 'new', 'editing', 'binding', 'published')
- Books need a viewable setting (boolean)
- Books need a topic

- Add MANY articles at once, do a mass upload
  - can we use Nokogiri to simplify this so they just provide urls and we grab all the details?

- All Authors view
- All Sources view

- Articles need an author and source field
  - this needs to add authors and sources correctly if they don't exist, rather than checkbox or dropdown
